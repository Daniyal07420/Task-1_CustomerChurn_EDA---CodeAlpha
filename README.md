# Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world customer churn dataset to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and to provide actionable business insights for customer retention.

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand customer behavior and churn patterns
- Identify high-risk customer segments
- Analyze the impact of contract type, age group, and monthly charges on churn
- Support data-driven retention strategies

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-level information including:
- Demographics (Age Group, Gender)
- Contract Type
- Monthly Charges
- Churn Status (Yes/No)
- Resolution Time

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (EDA)
- Power BI (Interactive Dashboard)
- GitHub

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Descriptive Analysis
- Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Customer Segmentation
- Churn Risk Analysis

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Highlights
- Total Customers, Churn Rate, Retained & Churned Customers KPIs
- Churn Distribution by Contract Type
- Customer Churn Trend by Age Group
- Monthly Charges vs Resolution Time
- High-Risk vs Low/Medium-Risk Customer Segmentation

## 💡 Key Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers show the highest churn
- Older age groups have higher churn rates
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn risk
- High-risk customers are concentrated in short-term contracts
  
## 📌 Business Recommendations
- Promote long-term contracts through discounts and offers
- Introduce retention plans for high-charge customers
- Improve service quality and resolution time for high-risk segments
